A cache tier provides Ceph Clients with better I/O performance for a subset of the data stored in a backing storage tier. 

Cache tiering involves creating a pool of relatively fast/expensive storage devices 
(e.g., solid state drives) configured to act as a cache tier, 
and a backing pool of either erasure-coded or relatively slower/cheaper devices 
configured to act as an economical storage tier. 

The Ceph objecter handles where to place the objects and the tiering agent determines 
when to flush objects from the cache to the backing storage tier. 

So the cache tier and the backing storage tier are completely transparent to Ceph clients.

To set up cache tiering, you must have two pools. One will act as the backing storage and the other will act as the cache.
