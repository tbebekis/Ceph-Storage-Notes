Due to file security demands by Ansible, the following files
    ansible.cfg
    hosts
moved to
    Ceph-Storage-Notes/Ansible
while Playbooks are in
    Ceph-Storage-Notes/Project

So in order to run a Playbook, execute the following
    cd /_Dev/Ceph-Storage-Notes/Ansible
    ansible-playbook ../Project/test.yml --ask-pass

If for any reason SSH Keys don't work, then use
    ansible-playbook ../Project/test.yml --ask-pass
