# Many hosts can be added at once using "ceph orch apply -i" by submitting a multi-document YAML file.

# file: hosts.yaml
service_type: host
hostname: node-00
addr: 192.168.0.10
labels:
- example1
- example2

service_type: host
hostname: node-01
addr: 192.168.0.11
labels:
- grafana
---
service_type: host
hostname: node-02
addr: 192.168.0.12

# mount the file
cephadm shell --mount hosts.yaml:/path/to/hosts.yaml

# cd to that folder
cd /path/to/hosts_file/

# apply
ceph orch apply -i hosts.yaml

# This can be combined with service specifications to create a cluster spec file to deploy a whole cluster in one command. 
# see "cephadm bootstrap --apply-spec" also to do this during bootstrap. 
# Cluster SSH Keys must be copied to hosts prior to adding them.
