# The Ceph Orchestrator deploys two Manager daemons by default. 
# NOTE: Ensure your deployment has at least 3 Ceph Managers in each deployment.

# You can deploy additional manager daemons using the placement specification in the CLI. 
# To deploy a different number of Manager daemons, specify a different number. 
# If you do not specify the hosts where the Manager daemons should be deployed, 
# the Ceph Orchestrator randomly selects the hosts and deploys the Manager daemons to them.
